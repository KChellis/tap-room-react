# Tap Room React
**A clone of taproom app previously created in angular 06.29.18**

## By Kristen Chellis

## Description
This is a recreation of an app that was originally built in Angular. This project instead uses React to build the same site that allows a user to see what kegs are available and admins to CRUD kegs.

## Component Structure
![Component Structure](/src/assets/images/chart.jpg)

## Notes
* spent several hours figuring out errors with react in atom. ended up having to uninstall and reinstall and create new project from scratch
* still building components, but thinking about how to either style without bootstrap, or how to add bootstrap.
* realized I don't actually need the NewKegControl component
* radio buttons for color are not working properly. I will need to research that, but want to get the rest of the page working first

## Setup Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Technologies
* React
* JavaScript
* CSS-Modules
* Webpack
* Bootstrap
